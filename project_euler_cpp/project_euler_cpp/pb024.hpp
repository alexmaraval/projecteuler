// with 10 digits there are 10! = 3628800 permutations
// if we start with '0' then there are 9 digits left to permute so starting with '0' there are 9! = 362880 permuations
// if we start with '1' there will also be 9! permutations so starting with '0' or one we have 2*9! = 725760 permutations.
// Therefore, to reach the 1'000'000 th permutation in the lexicographic order, it has to start with '2' because 3*9! = 1088640 permutations.
// we can continue this inductive reasonning:
//      now that we know that the first figit must be '2' we can count the permutations again with the 9 digits left to guess the second digit.
//      starting with '20' there are 8! = 40320 permutations so we have seen 725760 + 40320 = 766080 permutations,

// So '2783915406' is the permutation number 999'999 (indeed remember that permutation number 0 is 0123456789) so the 1'000'000th permutation has to be '2783915460'.
